# cygbin
This is ~/bin on my cygwin. This is a backup for me.
But you can use them under MIT License.

## contents
* my configs
* my public shell scripts
 * my private shell scripts are *.sh and ignored by .gitignore, so not backup here.

## install
```
cd ~
# LANG=C xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkuno9000/cygbin/master/myinit
source myinit
```
