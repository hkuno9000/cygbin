# cygbin
This is ~/bin on cygwin, git-for-windows, WSL, native Linux or macOS. This is a backup for me.
But you can use them under MIT License.

## contents
* my configs
* my public shell scripts
 * my private shell scripts are *.sh and ignored by .gitignore, so not backup here.

## install
```shell
cd ~
# LANG=C xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkuno9000/cygbin/master/myinit -O
  or
